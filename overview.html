        <p class="lead">Collins in 60 seconds</p>
        <p>
          The Collins web UI is very simple, only providing a small subset of the functionality available via the API.
          This document should be considered a user guide to Collins where a user is someone who provisions machines or
          occasionally needs to look up asset data. The information here will not be particularly useful for Collins
          API developers or Collins administrators. This is as close to a walkthrough or tour as you will get.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the tour we'll walk through the process of provisioning a server, as well as highlight some of the
          additional functionality available in the web UI. You can mostly just follow the screenshots unless you want
          additional information.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="label label-info">Heads up!</span> Most actions outside of logging in, searching, or viewing an
          asset will result in some action being taken. For instance, putting an asset in maintenance may generate a JIRA
          ticket for the datacenter team. Power cycling a host will cause it to be rebooted, and log the fact that you
          rebooted it. Be responsible.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="login">
        <div class="page-header">
          <h1>Login</h1>
        </div>
        <p class="lead">Getting into Collins</p>
        <p>
          At Tumblr you will use your LDAP credentials to authenticate to Collins. Your LDAP groups will determine the level
          of functionality you have available to you in collins. If you are not at Tumblr your administrator may be using
          flat-files or some other authentication mechanism. See your Collins administrator for login details.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you first go to collins you will be presented with an interface like the following.
        </p>
        <ul class="thumbnails">
          <li class="span9">
            <a href="img/collins_login.png" target="_blank" class="thumbnail">
              <img src="img/collins_login.png" alt="Account Login">
            </a>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Enter in your account credentials and hit the enter key or click sign-in to authenticate.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="label label-info">Heads up!</span> Authentication is required to do anything in collins. The only functionality
            available anonymously in Collins is the login page, the help page, and the timestamp API endpoint.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="search">
        <div class="page-header">
          <h1>Search</h1>
        </div>
        <p class="lead">Find the stuff you're looking for, fast</p>
        <p>
          Once you have authenticated to collins you should be presented with a search UI. The elements on the left in this interface
          are asset attributes (e.g. status, tag, etc) while the elements on the right are tags (e.g. hostname, pool, etc). The search
          fields on the left are fixed, the search fields on the right can be configured by your collins administrator.
        </p>
        <ul class="thumbnails">
          <li class="span9">
            <a href="img/collins_search.png" target="_blank" class="thumbnail">
              <img src="img/collins_search.png" alt="Search Page">
            </a>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In this interface you can search for assets that match the criteria you specify. Since we're looking for a server to provision,
          we're going to look for unallocated server nodes. Due to the current collins configuration, you can only provision Unallocated hosts.
          A sample search results page is below.
        </p>
        <ul class="thumbnails">
          <li class="span9">
            <a href="img/collins_search_results.png" target="_blank" class="thumbnail">
              <img src="img/collins_search_results.png" alt="Search Page">
            </a>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The search results page is color coded to reflect the status of the asset. Incomplete and new assets are <span class="text-warning">yellow</span>,
          provisioning and provisioned assets are <span class="text-info">blue</span>, cancelled and decommissioned assets are <span class="text-success">green</span>,
          and maintenance assets are <span class="text-error">red</span>. People usually ask why allocated/unallocated assets aren't green. Since allocated and
          unallocated are the default states, using green resulted in an all green search results page. No color was just better.

              The collins web UI tries to expose most of the actions you can take on an asset. Things like host provisioning, maintenance,
              logging and power management are all available to you. Which actions are available depends on the asset type, the asset status,
              the collins configuration, and your privileges. For instance, you can not provision an asset that is already allocated. You can
              not put an asset in maintenance mode that is already in maintenance mode. For the most part application actions are available
              only when they are applicable.
            </p>

              <span class="label label-info">Note</span> Everything below the divider line
              in the drop down is a potentially destructive or disruptive action and will be 
              called out as such in the UI.

          </div>

        <section id="asset-provisioning">
          <div class="page-header">
            <h2>Provisioning</h2>
          </div>
          <p>
          For provisioning purposes you'll want to search for hosts that are unallocated. Do not allocate hosts in any other state.
          </p>
          <p>
          To provision a host just click the 'Provision Server' link in the actions drop down. You will be presented with a dialog
          like the following:
          </p>
          <ul class="thumbnails">
            <li class="span6">
              <a href="img/asset_provision.png" target="_blank" class="thumbnail">
                <img src="img/asset_provision.png" alt="Host Provisioning">
              </a>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
          Depending on the profile you choose (web, database, etc) you will have a different set of configurable options made
          available to you. The profile and options you specify will dictate what role in the environment the host will eventually
          play. If something is optional (such as secondary role in this dialog) and you're unsure, just leave it unspecified.
          </p>
          <p>
          When you're ready just click the 'Provision Server' button. This takes 30-60 seconds to return. During this process we
          verify any required settings for the specified host and reboot it onto a reinstall image. Once control is returned to
          you, the dialog will close and you should notice that the primary role, pool, nodeclass, contact and some other options
          have been changed to reflect the settings you specified. Also note that the status has changed from Incomplete to Provisioning.
          </p>
          <p>
          Once the initial provisioning has successfully completed (the remaining steps, such as puppet and func cleanup), you'll
          see a hipchat notification in the builds room. Once the machine is fully provisioned, the status will change automatically
          to provisioned. In the near future we'll use the contact tag to again notify you that the machine has finished the
          provisioning process.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="asset-maintenance">
          <div class="page-header">
            <h2>Maintenance</h2>
          </div>
          <p>
          On occasion you will need to put an asset into maintenance. In our environment, once you do that this triggers a few events
          such as pulling the host out of any upstream proxy configurations or potentially re-generating DNS. This should generally
          be something performed by people on the operations team, however there may be times when you need a machine that has had some
          kind of provisioning problem occur go into maintenance so you can reprovision it. In that case, again in the actions drop down,
          you can just click the start maintenance button to change the status of the machine to maintenance mode. Once in maintenance
          mode you can reprovision the host if needed. If you're unsure, ask the person listed under the contact tag.
          </p>
          <ul class="thumbnails">
            <li class="span6">
              <a href="img/asset_maintenance.png" target="_blank" class="thumbnail">

              </a>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
          In EWR, putting a host into maintenance mode will cause a JIRA ticket to be generated if the maintenance type you select is
          HARDWARE_PROBLEM, IPMI_PROBLEM, or NETWORK_PROBLEM so choose a state accordingly.

          <div class="page-header">
            <h2>Cancellation</h2>
          </div>
          <p>
            Cancelling a server will cause it to be handed back to any neccesary hosting providers, and will shred the filesystem data before
            doing so. This process takes 3-5 days to complete. Server cancellations should generally only be done by people on the SRE or operations
            teams.

          <div class="page-header">
            <h2>Deletion</h2>
          </div>
          <p>
            There are rare occasions, particularly if an asset went through intake with bad data (e.g. the wrong tag), where you may
            want to actually delete an asset. At Tumblr this can be performed by the datacenter team or Blake. This is an absolutely
            destructive act and should generally not be done.
          </p>
          <ul class="thumbnails">

            If you have appropriate permissions you can delete an asset via the web UI. This option is not available via the API.

          </div>
          <p>
            A variety of power management functions are available in the UI. In fact, some of these are only available in the UI. These allow
            you to perform actions like soft reboots, hard reboots, powering off a machine, etc. Note that what power actions are available
            when an asset is allocated is configurable, so some power actions may not be available.

          <div class="page-header">
            <h2>Log Creation</h2>
          </div>
          <p>
            The logs for an asset are created by both internal and external processes. There is an API available for creating new log
            entries and querying existing ones, but log entries are immutable and permanent, there is no delete support, even once an asset
            is decommissioned. These logs give you a permanent historical view of lifecycle related events such as provisions and cancellations
            as well as changes in tag values.
          </p>
          <ul class="thumbnails">
            <li class="span6">
              <a href="img/asset_note.png" target="_blank" class="thumbnail">

              </a>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Although in the UI you will see a few entries that say "User unknown", the user account record is actually stored and this is a UI
            bug. By design, no changes or updates to an asset can happen without leaving some kind of an audit trail.

              If an activation plugin has been configured you will be able to provision virtual assets.
              These hosts will have a status of Incomplete. Activation will move the host into New until
              it is ready for use. The UI for this is nearly identical to provisioning because the
              provisioning process will run once the host is available.

            If you are an administrator you should find a link named 'Logging'. This will show you
            an up to date view of all logged activity in the system. Clicking the auto refresh button
            will cause the UI to refresh periodically and display any new log entries.

            There is no link to this page but if you are an administrator you can get to it at
            <code>/admin/stats</code> This will show you various stat information and also allow
            you to clear the cache. The clear cache button only exists in case you manually modify
            something in the DB and want the cache to refresh.

                It is possible as an adminstrator to create assets (not servers) from the web UI. Really this
                is pretty much only useful for configuration assets, but the functionality is there.

                The creation interface requires that you specify a tag, whether IPMI information
                should be generated or not, and the asset status. It is not possible to specify
                any additional information via this interface.
