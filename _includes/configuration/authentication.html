<h2>Authentication <small><span class="label label-info">Namespace</span> <span class="inlinecode">authentication</span></small></h2>

<p>
Collins supports a variety of authentication backends along with a flexible API endpoint based
permissions system. Some features also have specific permissions.
</p>

<p>
Collins comes bundled with a small in memory authentication mechanism for testing, file based
authentication, and LDAP based authentication. There is not yet support for LDAPS authentication
so if you use LDAP we recommend running a slave on the collins host.

<p>
The permissions example below creates two user groups, admins and tools. User groups are just named groups of users
that are stored in the YAML file. This is useful for people authenticating with flat files or if you want to store
some group information here. The admins user group has two users, alan and bmatheny. The tools user group has three
users. There are two feature permissions specified, one for rate limiting and the other for who can see passwords.
The last permission is for the powerStatus API endpoint and is open to a broader group of users. Every API permission
name is documented in the API documentation.

<h3>LDAP Authentication <small><span class="label label-info">Namespace</span> <span class="inlinecode">authentication.ldap</span></small></h3>

<p>
At Tumblr LDAP is the primary authentication mechanism. We have tested that this code works with
at least RFC 2307, IPA, and the OS X admin server.

        One of rfc2307 or rfc2307bis. Defaults to rfc2307bis. This
        configuration dictates how group queries are performed. rfc2307 will
        query as $groupAttribute=username (e.g. memberUid=fizzbuzz), rfc2307bis
        will query as $groupAttribute=DN (e.g.  uniqueMember=uid=fizzbuzz,ou=people,dc=example,dc=org).

<h3>File Authentication <small><span class="label label-info">Namespace</span> <span class="inlinecode">authentication.file</span></small></h3>

<p>
The file format used is a variation on that used by Apache. You can find a sample script for generating
users and passwords in <code>scripts/gen_passwords.sh</code>.

<h3>Mixed Authentication</h3>

<p>
Mixed authentication allows collins to use multiple authentication backends
simultaneously. An example use-case could be a scenario where real users live in
LDAP but system users (for automation etc.) are defined using file
authentication.
</p>
<p>
To use mixed authentication, simply specify a list of authentication backends as
the type, and add configuration (as described above) for each of them within the
authentication block. A simple example can be seen below.
</p>
<p>
The mixed authentication provider will try each of the methods in the order
listed and use the first one that returns a successful match.
</p>

<div class="example reference-config">
<pre>authentication {
  type = "file,ldap"

  file {
    userfile = "conf/users.conf"
  }

  ldap {
    host = "localhost"
    groupAttribute = "uniqueMember"
    searchbase = "dc=example,dc=org"
    usersub = "ou=people"
    groupsub = "ou=groups"
  }
}</pre>

</div>
