/**
 * scala has no multi-set, so let's make one!
 *
 * A MultiSet (MSet) is basically a Set that allows duplicate items.  The
 * duplicates are handled by keeping a count with each distinct item.
 *
 * We use MSets in Solr multi-values, since we don't care about the order, but
 * we need to retain duplicates (mainly for NUM_DISKS), and this was easier
 * that writing orderings for all the value types
 *
 * This is a very basic and unoptimized MSet that only supports exactly what we
 * need from it, this should be expanded to fit in more with regular scala
 * collections
