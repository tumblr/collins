## Internal (Tumblr) docs

To create a production zip and deploy to production:
  - ensure capistrano 2.15.5 is installed
  - ensure net-ssh < 2.7.0 is installed - versions 2.7.0 and above are broken with our environment
  - download and unpackage play @ ~/src/play-2.2.6 or define $PLAY_CMD with an alternate location
  - run `./scripts/package.sh` which will produce `target/collins.zip`
  - run `cap publish:collins` which will upload and link to release to `http://repo.tumblr.net:8888/collins.zip`
  - run `cap ewr01 deploy` to deploy to ewr01 and `cap d2 deploy` to deploy to d2
